# Fast Buddy

(In the process of being rewritten using the BLoC design pattern)

Fast Buddy is a minimalist fasting companion app designed to help users track and achieve their fasting goals. Fasting has been shown to offer a range of health benefits, from improved insulin sensitivity to reduced inflammation, making it an increasingly popular wellness practice.

Unlike other fasting apps, which rely on timers that simply count down until the fasting period is over, Fast Buddy employs a stopwatch to offer greater flexibility and precision in your tracking. 

The app features three screens : 

- The first allows users to start and monitor their current fast.
- The second provides an history of past fasting sessions.
- The third summarizes key statistics.

One of Fast Buddy's standout features is its red circular indicator, which tracks progress towards autophagy, a state of cellular cleansing that occurs during extended fasting periods. I will be adding features in the future.
